We are now releasing the Planetaria Star Update, version 1.1 for iOS. In this update, the scope of Planetaria has been expanded from the Solar System to the entire galaxy, as you can now explore hundreds of other stars and their systems. Some notable favorites include Betelgeuse, Polaris, and UY Scuti; be sure to check them out.

Since there are now additional stars besides the Sun in the app, stars now include other data points like celestial coordinates, color, and measurements based on the Sun (e.g. mass relative to Sun's - solar masses). New images have been added to represent different types of stars. Also, the app's interface fonts and stylings were tweaked slightly.

The app now has a new screen upon entry from which you can navigate to either the Solar System (which shows you the Sun, planets, moons, comets, and asteroids) or the Galaxy (which shows you stars, star systems, and exoplanets). There's also a new search feature to make it easier to find astronomical objects. Just type in whatever you want to find, or its description. You could even search for something like "brown dwarf," and all of the brown dwarf stars would come up.

Finally, the Planetaria Website will be releasing to coincide with this iOS release. It will be in a [separate post](./210215-pt-website).

### Official Updated Description:
There is so much to explore in space: from the smallest comets that orbit the Sun every couple thousand years, to the planets that crown the Solar System, and the enormous stars seen from hundreds of light years away. Planetaria is a cumulative catalog of the astronomical objects in the Solar System and the Galaxy. Explore our local objects: the Sun, the eight planets, the dwarf planets, over two hundred moons, as well as small bodies like asteroids and comets. And now, explore beyond our system to find hundreds of stars and exoplanets waiting for discovery. See their stories, their beauty, their characteristics, and their impact. The universe is waiting to be explored with Planetaria.
