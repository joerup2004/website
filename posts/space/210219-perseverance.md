Yesterday NASA's Perseverance rover landed on [Mars](http://planetaria.app/planets/Mars) in a new breakthrough of human innovation. The spacecraft carrying the most massive rover ever sent to Mars arrived in the Martian atmosphere around 3:50pm EST Thursday at a staggering 12,000 mph. In the next seven minutes, it decelerated to around 2 mph using its heat shield as it plummetted toward the Red Planet. Then the skycrane was deployed which safely dispatched the Perseverance rover onto the ground. In the minutes following the landing, the first pictures were sent back to Earth.

There was also a stowaway onboard the spacecraft: the Ingenuity helicopter. This helicopter will conduct tests on the Martian surface in the coming months, becoming the first human-made vehicle that will fly on the surface of another planet. 

Now that the Perseverance rover has successfully landed, it will begin its mission. It is scheduled to operate for one Mars year (about 1.9 Earth years), but it will likely stay in operation for longer. Its goal is to search the Jezero Crater, likely to have once been a lake of water, for signs of any ancient Martian life forms that would have been around over three billion years ago. It will collect samples of rock which will eventually be returned to Earth in the early 2030s. 

Until then, the Perseverance rover will travel alone through the cold Martian desert.
