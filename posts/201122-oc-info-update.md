The first content update for Omega Calculator has now been released. Version 1.2.0 brings a new Information tab in settings which is essentially a user guide; it tells you about the buttons' purposes and functionalities. This tab will likely be expanded in the future.

Also, the new version includes over 30 new app icons which will automatically update when the theme is changed. You will have to change your theme in the new update for the icon change to take effect, but the app icon should now match the interface theme. A few themes have been reworked as well: the "Coral" theme was renamed to "Classic Pink" and brought up to the top row. A new purple-blue "Coral" has been created for the "The Sea" category. To match the new "Classic Pink," the old "Classic" was also renamed to "Classic Blue."
