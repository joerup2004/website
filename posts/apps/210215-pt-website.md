Today we are launching the Planetaria website, available at [planetaria.app](https://planetaria.app). After over a month of attempting to bring the iOS App to the web, today it is finally released. The website is extremely similar to the app, although it is accessible from all devices, not just those running iOS. It is also able to be constantly updated, instead of requiring the full App Store update.

The Planetaria website is already running the new [Planetaria Star Update](./210214-pt-star-update). The website's release coincides with the update for the iOS App, which brings all of the new features like stars and exoplanets to both versions. In the future, features will hopefully come to the website and app simultaneously as they did with this version.
