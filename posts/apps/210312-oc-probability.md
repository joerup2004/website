Today we are releasing the Omega Calculator Probability Update, version 1.3.0 for iOS. This is the largest update since Omega's release. Seven new operations have been added: permutations, combinations, modulo, random number, round, floor, and ceiling. Permutations and combinations are important operations in probability to determine the amount of outcomes of a situation. Modulo is used mostly in computer science to compute the remainder of division. Random number enters an unknown number between 0 and 1, and round obviously rounds a number. Floor rounds a number down always; ceiling (ceil) rounds a number up always.

These new buttons can be found throughout the newly redesigned landscape calculator arrangement. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd... function buttons have been placed at the bottom of the screen for quick access, and the rest of the buttons have been rearranged for more convenient access. There is also now a main menu for the app, accessible through the four horizontal lines in the top left (this used to be the settings button). The main menu lets you navigate around different parts of the app. The main calculator is first, then your stored & saved calculations. The Guide tab (formerly Information tab) is there too with a new overhaul of content, including a generic guide and expanded information. The Theme Tab (formerly accessible through settings) and the rest of settings are accessible below this.

Speaking of settings, they have been tweaked. Two new settings let you use light (non-bolded) text for calculations and for buttons. There is also a new setting to automatically add parentheses after a trig function or logarithm. Two settings which are not used anymore have been removed: the return to 1st always and the show next button settings; the landscape view has been redesigned so these are no longer required.
